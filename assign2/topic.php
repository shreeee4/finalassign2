		<h2 id="topic_description">What is Internet of Things?</h2>
		<p id="first">
			In technical terms, Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected devices, mechanical and digital machinery, with unique identifiers and the ability to communicate to each other without human interference in any process. Simply put, it is connecting things to the internet to yield all the amazing perks it adds to the device and its functioning.

		<h3 id="importance">Why is IoT so important?</h3>
		<p id="second">With one smartphone connected to the internet, you can access a multitude of information from all over the world. This is not because your smartphone has a super storage but because it is connected to a a super storage or a super computer. With a connection to the internet, your device can send and receive limitless information thus making it so much more useful than it would be without the connection.</p>
		<p>All devices in IoT have one of the three functions:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><span class="name">Sensors:</span> They are responsible for collecting and sending information.<br>
				For example, temperature and light sensors paired with internet connection will allow us to collect information and analyse it to make beneficial decisions for the future.</li>
			<li><span class="name">Computers:</span> They receive information and act accordingly.<br>
				We have plenty of examples of devices that act according to the input information. For example, a printer prints after it receives a document from the computer .</li>
			<li>Things that act as <span class="name">Sensors and Computers</span>.<br>
				This is where we really benefit from IoT! Systems that can collect information and act depending on the data it collects is what makes IoT so special. For example, having a temperature and light sensor in a green house along with water sprinklers and window shields will make a farmer's job so much easier as the system can be automated to maintain a perfect temperature and sunlight for the plant to grow.<br>
				Not only that, the data collected can then be used to create a system that will increase the yield of crops in more efficient ways.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>With proper use of IoT, we can get a different and broader perspective of things around us and use it to step up to a greater level of influence.</p>

		<h2 id="history">A Brief History of IoT</h2>
		<p>While the oldest known examples of IoT was in a 1980s where local programmers at Carnegie Mellon University would connect to the refrigerator to check if a cold drink was available or not before making a visit, it was <span class="name">Kevin Ashton</span> from MIT's Director Board who coined the term "Internet of Things". Though the definition is much evolved now, the gist of the phrase remains.
		</p>
		<p>Eventually, the use of IoT extended to community in terms of building smart cities, industrial uses to increase the efficiency and reliabitily of the production process and more ranging from mobile devices and automated cars to the healthcare industry.</p>

			<p>When AI and IoT are combined, the gadget is said to become "smart." AI enables IoT devices to learn, evaluate, create insights, and make informed decisions based on data obtained without the assistance of humans. The AIoT occurs when data is analysed in the IoT evolving the gadgets into "smart" devices.</p>
		</aside>
		<h2 id="future">Future of IoT</h2>
		<p>IoT is driven by three powerful, emerging technologies - </p>
		<dl>
			<dt><span class="name">Big Data:</span></dt>
			<dd>Data collected from a multitude of devices connected to the internet, that are too large to be processed by normal methods.</dd>
			<dt><span class="name">5G:</span></dt>
			<dd>Ultra speedy fifth generation mobile network that allows real-time data processing with it's near-zero latency feature.</dd>
			<dt><span class="name">Artificial Intelligence:</span></dt>
			<dd>Programming devices such that they retain information allowing them to learn, reason and process like a human being.</dd>
		</dl>
		<p>In the near future, we see IoT bringing remarkable changes in markets that include Wearable, Smart Home Devices, Smart City Devices and Smart Industry Devices. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/what-is-aiot?msclkid=946732c4ab3b11eca806d56ec89f636f">Click here</a> to learn more about AIoT.</p>

		<h2 id="vs">IoT vs Cloud Computing</h2>
		<p>Since people often confuse the two with each other, here is a table listing the information that differentiate the two.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Items</th>
				<th>IoT</th>
				<th>Cloud Computing</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Characteristics</td>
				<td>IoT is done on real world objects.</td>
