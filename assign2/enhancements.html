        <h2>Animation on Page Header</h2>
        <p class="para2">
          The page headers are made to slide into the screen from the left to
          right and it is achieved by styling the #page_header ID with the
          animation property. Using the sub-properties of the animation property
          like the animation-name, animation-duration and animation-fill-mode,
          we have configured the features that we want our animation to have. We
          have then used keyframes to mark the position of the shot at the
          specific points allowing us to have a smooth transition in the
          animation. For the page header, we have configured the animation
          duration as 2s and the animation moving from left to right stopping
          towards the center of the page.

        <h2>Drop-up on Footer Content</h2>
        <p class="para2">
          We first create the class for the element where we want the drop-up
          feature. Since the feature was used on our 'Email the Creators'
          button, a drop-up class using 'div' was created. A button with class
          button was created within the .dropup class and the button was styled
          according to preference. For the drop-up content, a .mail_links class
          was created with 'a href' linking the mail of each group member. The
          .mail_links was styled such that its 'display' remained 'hidden'
          initially and upon hovering over the .dropup class, it would 'display'
          as a 'block'.
